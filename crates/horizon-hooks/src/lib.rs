//! The game's extension points for code above the engine (docs/layers.md, "How a Horizon crate
//! plugs in"). A platform or Horizon crate implements [`Hooks`] and [`register`]s it before the
//! game starts; the engine calls every registered hook at the points below. This crate names no
//! type from above, so the engine can offer it; `horizon-platform` re-exports it as
//! `horizon_platform::hooks`, which is where the Horizon layer uses it from.
//!
//! Registration happens once, before the game runs: the list is sealed the first time the engine
//! dispatches, and a hook registered after that is refused. With nothing registered a dispatch
//! is one load and an empty loop.
//!
//! A new hook is a new method with an empty default body, so existing implementations keep
//! compiling, and a dispatch function in [`engine`] that the engine calls at the place vanilla
//! does the matching thing.
